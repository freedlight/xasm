# xasm
multi-CPU assembler, command line only

This macro assembler compiles with Borland C++ under MS-DOS.  The supported CPUs are pretty much useless nowadays, but this has been used for production code for ROM embedded systems.  It includes a suite to validate the code generation.

The hooks are made avalable for many more CPUs, but that code has never been written.
